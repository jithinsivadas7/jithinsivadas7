# Hi there! I'm Jithin

I've been building websites (SaaS & Web Apps) using PHP for over 6 years. I focus on creating user-friendly and interactive experiences.

### Here's what I do:

- Full-stack development with PHP and JavaScript
- Use frameworks like Laravel, CodeIgniter, NestJS
- Create interactive interfaces with React and Vue.js
- Host websites on cloud services like AWS and Digital Ocean
- Manage databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL
- Keep servers running smoothly with Linux administration
- Track code changes using Git
- Write reliable code with Test-Driven Development (TDD)

I'm detail-oriented and passionate about making your ideas a reality!
